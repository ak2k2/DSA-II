# Armaan Kapoor - ECE-365 - Programming Assignment #3: Dijsktra's Algorithm Using Binary Heap

## To Run:
1. `$ make clean all'
1. '$ bin/./graphApp.exe'

## Professor Sable:
- I construct MyGraph (graph.cpp:main:164) with a capacity of 10,000,000 nodes. I am assuming that this is a sufficient capacity but resize should work.
